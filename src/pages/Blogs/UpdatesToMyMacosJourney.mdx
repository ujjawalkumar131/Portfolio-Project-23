## Updates to my MacOS Journey

> Last time I talked about MacOS, I had some criticisms, along with a lot of good to say about the hardware.
> Now, I have had some more time to use this machine and this OS and so, here is a **better look** at MacOS

#### The hardware... now

The hardware on my machine (The base model macbook air M1) were really good
when it came out and its still holds true. The hardware has grown on me even
more since the last time and that is mainly due to the `still awesome` battery
and dated looking but still kick-ass display and keyboard.

The keyboard has grown on me and it hits a good balance of tactile feel and comfort.
I dont hate any part of it but i'd still personally take my custom keyboard over it, but
that's just because i love that board. I have felt awesome with this keyboard whenever i'm
on a plane or travelling or just anywhere i'd feel like it and this has reaised the bar for me
in terms of what i expect of a laptop keyboard. 

The display is also really good. I have an external display and whenever i'm at my hostel
the macbook is plugged to that but i still find the display relly good. Its sharp for the
times i wanna use it, The brightness is more than adequate and i never feel like i can't
see something even at the rare times i use it outside. So yeah it really good.

The battery is still going strong and is genuinely one of the most life changing things about
this laptop. I never had any machine with such a strong battery life and now that i do, I
put a lot more emphasis on the battery life than i ever did. My battery health is still good
and i can get through a day with a lot of usage or even three with light usage.

### The Software

#### The Terminal

The terminal on MacOS was the only definite strong point last time and it is `still strong`.
I have found some things to be lacking as compared to linux but that is to be expected
and rarer than i'd have initially expect. I have switched to an even more terminal centric
workflow and its been awesome. I usually have nvim and one tmux session with anywhere between
2-4 terminal sessions and this machine has never lagged badly nor has the battery gotten
noticably worse.

#### The Window Management
