# About:

> This is a simple*ish* portfolio site, built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.org).

It is a constant WIP and i wanna try keeping it up to snuff. But the web-dev world moves too fast for any one stack to be any dev's
favorite for too long.

The blogs are handled with mdx in the pages/Blogs directory, and the descriptions for said blogs are in the descriptions.ts file in the root dir.

It is hosted on [Here](https://lohitaksha.com) with vercel.
